## Body diagram geometry

The muscle outlines the body maps are drawn from (`frontend/src/lib/body-paths.js`) are derived
from [**MuscleMap**](https://github.com/melihcolpan/MuscleMap) by Melih Colpan, used under the
**MIT License** and reproduced below. MuscleMap ships its path data as Swift source rather than
`.svg` files; the paths were converted to a JSON module, its sub-group shapes were dropped, and
nothing else about the artwork was changed.

## Exercise data & media

The exercise names, instructions (English in `frontend/src/lib/exercises-data.js`, other
languages in `frontend/src/instr/`, regenerated via `scripts/build-instructions.mjs`), images
and animations (fetched into `media/` at build time) come from
[**hasaneyldrm/exercises-dataset**](https://github.com/hasaneyldrm/exercises-dataset)
and are **not** covered by openGym's MIT license — they remain under that dataset's own terms.
The media files are not distributed in this repository; they are downloaded from the upstream
source on first run. If you redistribute openGym with the media included, review the upstream
license first.
